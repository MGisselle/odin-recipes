    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper or foil liners.</li>
        <li>Spoon flour into a measuring cup and level off with a knife. Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Add flour mixture in two batches, alternating with mik; mix only until no streaks of flour remain.</li>
        <li>Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling each 1/2 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 15 to 17 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely before serving or frosting. </li>
    </ol>
